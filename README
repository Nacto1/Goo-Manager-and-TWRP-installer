Recovery Zip that installs the Team Win Recovery Project (TWRP) and the GooManager app.
    All devices but mecha and blaze will probably not install GooManager correctly.

               Let me know if one works. Email lukeafrazier@gmail.com

 I need the /data partition (/dev/block/mmcblkXpXX) for all devices but mecha and blaze.
